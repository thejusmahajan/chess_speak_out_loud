## 2026-07-19 — Leader (Claude Code) — Phase 0: design + foundations
- Verified oracle APIs (plan §2 table) directly against source.
- Added public `NeuralVision.saliency_absolute(fen)` (absolute frame, both colors,
  falls back gracefully) — training code must use this, never `saliency()`.
- Wrote and tested `backend/training/metrics.py` (normative math). Smoke tests:
  `ALL METRICS TESTS PASSED` (policy divergence severities, en-passant interaction
  squares, attention blindness, mover-POV confirmation swing incl. mate strings,
  quietness, top4 concentration, hidden-gem gate, WDL sharpness, alt solutions).
- Published `TRAINING_SYSTEM_PLAN.md`, `GEMINI_TRAINING_TASKS.md`,
  `CLAUDE_TRAINING_TASKS.md`.
- Open: nothing. Next: Gemini G1 ∥ Claude C1.
